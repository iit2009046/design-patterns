Prototype allows us to hide the complexity of making new instances from the client. The concept is to copy an existing
object rather than creating a new instance from scratch, something that may include costly operations. The existing
object acts as a prototype and contains the state of the object. The newly copied object may change same properties
only if required. This approach saves costly resources and time, especially when the object creation is a heavy process.

The prototype pattern is a creational design pattern. Prototype patterns is required, when object creation is time
consuming, and costly operation, so we create object with existing object itself. One of the best available way to
create object from existing objects are clone() method. Clone is the simplest approach to implement prototype pattern.
However, it is your call to decide how to copy existing object based on your business model


Java libraries examples:

java.lang.Object#clone() (the class has to implement java.lang.Cloneable)
