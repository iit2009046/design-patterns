Java libraries examples:

javax.faces.context.FacesContext, it internally uses among others the abstract/interface types LifeCycle,
ViewHandler, NavigationHandler and many more without that the enduser has to worry about it (which are however overrideable by injection).
javax.faces.context.ExternalContext, which internally uses ServletContext, HttpSession, HttpServletRequest, HttpServletResponse, etc.
