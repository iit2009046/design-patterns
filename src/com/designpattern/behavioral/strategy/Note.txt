In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a software design pattern that enables an algorithmâ€™s behavior to be selected at runtime. The strategy pattern

defines a family of algorithms,
encapsulates each algorithm, and
makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family.



Java libraries examples:

java.util.Comparator#compare(), executed by among others Collections#sort().
javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet, the service() and all doXXX() methods take HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse and the implementor has to process them (and not to get hold of them as instance variables!).
javax.servlet.Filter#doFilter()
