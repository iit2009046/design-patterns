Java libraries examples:

java.util.Comparator#compare(), executed by among others Collections#sort().
javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet, the service() and all doXXX() methods take HttpServletRequest and HttpServletResponse and the implementor has to process them (and not to get hold of them as instance variables!).
javax.servlet.Filter#doFilter()
