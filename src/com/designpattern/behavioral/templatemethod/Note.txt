Template method design pattern is to define an algorithm as skeleton of operations and leave the details to be implemented by the child classes.
The overall structure and sequence of the algorithm is preserved by the parent class.
Template means Preset format like HTML templates which has fixed preset format.
Similarly in template method pattern,we have a preset structure method called template method which consists of steps.
This steps can be abstract method which will be implemented by its subclasses.

This behavioral design pattern is one of the easiest to understand and implement.
This design pattern is used popularly in framework development. This helps to avoid code duplication also.





Java libraries examples:

All non-abstract methods of java.io.InputStream, java.io.OutputStream, java.io.Reader and java.io.Writer.
All non-abstract methods of java.util.AbstractList, java.util.AbstractSet and java.util.AbstractMap.
javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet, all the doXXX() methods by default sends a HTTP 405 "Method Not Allowed"
error to the response. You're free to implement none or any of them.
